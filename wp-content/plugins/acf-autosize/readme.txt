A wordpress plugin to automatically resize and improve upon wysiwyg and textarea fields in Advanced Custom Fields.

== Description ==

## Features
- Automatically resize wysiwyg and textarea fields in ACF groups
- Add `data-wysiwyg-slug='my-wysiwyg-field'` to the body in tinymce iframes, so you can style those iframe's contents using editor-styles.

## Limitations
- Currently does not work on fields inside of ACF Gutenberg Blocks.

## Usage
- Install and activate like any other wordpress plugin
- `[data-wysiwyg-slug]` is added to *every* wysiwyg field!
- The plugin is enabled by default on all textareas and wysiwyg fields. You can disable it by adding the class `no-autosize` to a field.
- You can set the the default behaviour to false via the `acf-autosize/enabledByDefault`-filter. After that you can reenable single fields by adding the class `autosize`.
- Set `min-height` of WYSIWYG-fields via `acf-autosize/wysiwyg/min-height`-filter. 
- The plugin can be enabled in the frontend via `acf-autosize/enabledInFrontend`-filter.

## mu-plugin
`acf-autosize-mu.php` is a single-file drop-in version of acf-autosize for usage in your theme or mu-plugins. It contains the javascript and is autogenerated!
